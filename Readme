We created Jupyter Notebook tutorial which provide an easily accessible step-by-step walkthrough on how to build the social identity detection model. We also provided a tutorial on how to preprocess the raw text data and convert it to LIWC feature vectors in a robust way. 


If unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebooks, instructions for installing and running can be found here: http://jupyter.org/install. Before installing Jupyter Notebook, make sure that Python is installed (our code is with Python3) in your system. We recommend installing Python and Jupyter using the conda package manager.
