**Tutorials**

We created Jupyter Notebook tutorials which provide an easily accessible step-by-step walkthrough on how to build the salient social identity detection model (ASIA: Automated Social Identity Assessment Using Linguistic Style). 


- Data prepration. This tutorial provides the instruction and code on how to preprocess the raw text data and convert it to LIWC feature vectors in a robust way. An example file is provided to try and test the tutorial.  
- Salient social identity detection model.
We provide the instructions and code to build the salient social identity detection model. The user would be abe to run the code using the provided dataset, or his/her own datasets after following the data prepration tutorial. 
- Domain adaptation. In case that train and test data are drawn from different distributions (domains), it is advised to apply the domain adaptation to shift the source and target distributions towards each other. This tutorial provides the full explanation of the concept of domain adaptation and the code to instructions required to apply the 'Unsupervised visual domain adaptation using subspace alignment'.

**Important point to consider when using the Salient Social Identity Detection Model:**

online communities should be carefully selected to represent the desired social identities, both for training and applying the model. What we mean from representativeness of an online community is that its content should be dominated by the users who have the desired social identity. For example,
